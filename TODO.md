Create scaffolds for:
  * Simple
  * Complicated
  * Complex
  * Complex-Plus

Scaffolds should include check to `#payload_correct?`

Scaffolds from Complicated up should read `#pulse_size`.

Make hits for:
  * converting binary string to integer.
  * converting binary string to character.
  * reading a bit from source, for simple -- note it will only work for simple.
  * reading a byte from source, for simple -- note it will only work for simple.
  * reading a bit from source, for complex -- note it will work for complex or simple.
  * reading a byte from source, for complex -- note it will work for complex or simple.
  * Smoothing input errors to remove noise.
