Don't worry about pulse sizes, at all. Just use `#pulse_size`.

Make sources for:
  * "complex", where each pulse is represented equal large number of 1s or 0s.
  * "complicated", like "complex" but with pulse length skew. Hardcode skew in to be -5% of pulse size.

Make examples in solution about:
  * how to convert an array of arrays of 1/0 characters to a character.
  * reading a bit from source, for simple.
  * reading a byte from source, for simple.
  * "complex"
  * "complicated"
